#Question 7

#Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"} #This hash uses a symbol (incidentally, x) to point to the key "some value"
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"} #this hash uses x (which points to the string "hi there") as its key. 

#What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

#ANSWER - See above.
